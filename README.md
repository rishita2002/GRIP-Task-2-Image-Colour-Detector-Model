Computer Vision often abbreviated as CV, is defined as a field of study that seeks to develop techniques to help computers ‘see’ and understand the content of digital images such as photographs and videos.

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs — and take actions or make recommendations based on that information. If AI enables computers to think, computer vision enables them to see, observe and understand.
